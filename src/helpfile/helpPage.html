<h3>New Window</h3>

<p>
    The New Window button allows for multiple instances of the calculator to be opened at once.
</p>

<h3>Print</h3>

<p>
    The printing feature on this calculator allows users to print out their calculation results for easy reference and
    record keeping. Simply press the "print" button after completing a calculation, and the result will be printed on a
    small, attached printer. This convenient feature eliminates the need for manual writing and helps users easily keep
    track of their calculations.</p>


<h3>Preferences</h3>

    - Polar Mode: The polar mode feature on a calculator allows users to perform calculations using polar coordinates,
    which represent a point in a two-dimensional plane using the distance from the origin and the angle from the
    positive x-axis. This mode is useful for calculations involving circular or angular measurements, such as
    calculating the area of a circle or the length of an arc. The calculator can convert between rectangular and polar
    coordinates, and perform various mathematical operations in this mode.
    <br>
    - Trailing Zeros: It has a feature that allows it to print trailing zeros after decimal points. This means that if
    the result of your calculation has decimal points, the calculator will automatically add zeros after the decimal
    point to make the number more precise and accurate. This feature is especially useful for students and professionals
    who need to present their calculations in a clear and concise manner.

<h3>Graph</h3>

<p>
    The graph feature on a complex number calculator allows users to visually represent complex numbers in the complex
    plane. This allows for easy visualization of the magnitude and phase of complex numbers, as well as the ability to
    perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The graph can also be adjusted to
    display the real and imaginary parts separately, making it useful for understanding the properties of complex
    numbers.

<h3>History</h3>


</p>
The calculator is a powerful tool that can store previously entered expressions for easy recall and use. With this
calculator, users can save time and effort by reusing complex equations without having to re-enter them each time. It
also allows for quick and easy reference to past calculations for comparison or further analysis. This versatile
calculator is a useful tool for students, professionals, and anyone who frequently performs calculations.
